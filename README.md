👋🏻 I'm Christine, a SWE II on Microsoft Teams iOS development team. I am passionate about building & designing digital products that empower individuals. 
👩🏻‍💻 Graduated from Vanderbilt University with a double degree in Computer Science & Mathematics, my academic background & research experience gives me a solid foundation in OOP and data analysis. Having worked with multiple organizations on UI projects, I am also experienced with UI tool kits such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, Sketch, etc. 
📸 My hobbies extend from regularly creating fashion-related content on Youtube & Instagram, running marathons, and being a part-time engagement/wedding photographer. 
🌟 Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about software engineer opportunities, photography, UI development, machine learning, or filmmaking!
