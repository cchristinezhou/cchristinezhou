- 👋 Hi, I'm Christine, a third-year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Vanderbilt University. 
Joining Microsoft as a SWE Intern this summer, I am passionate about building & designing digital products that empower individuals. 
- 🌱 My academic background & research experience gives me a solid foundation in OOP and data analysis. 
Having worked with multiple organizations on UI projects, I am also experienced with UI tool kits such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Figma, Sketch, etc. 
- 💞️ My hobbies extend from regularly creating fashion-related content on Youtube & Instagram, running marathons, and taking crazy (good, hopefully) photos. 
Please feel free to reach out if you want to talk about software engineer opportunities, UI development, machine learning, or filmmaking!
